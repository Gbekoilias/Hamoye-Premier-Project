Theme: *Food Security and Access- to prevent malnutrition*

Topic: *Food Accessibility and Profitability*

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/agricultural-survey-of-african-farm-households

Context: Surveys for more than 9,500 households were conducted in the growing seasons 2002/2003 or 2003/2004 in eleven African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Niger and Senegal in western Africa; Egypt in northern Africa; Ethiopia and Kenya in eastern Africa; South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe in southern Africa. Households were chosen randomly in districts that are representative for key agro-climatic zones and farming systems. The data set specifies farming systems characteristics that can help inform about the importance of each system for a country’s agricultural production and its ability to cope with short- and long-term climate changes or extreme weather events. Further it informs about the location of smallholders and vulnerable systems and permits benchmarking agricultural systems characteristics.

Content: The data file contains survey data collected from different families and has 9597 rows that represent the households and 1753 columns with details about the households. The questionnaire was organized into seven sections and respondents were asked to relate the information provided to the previous 12 months’ farming season. There are too many columns to describe here, however they are described in detail in this paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201620?WT.ec_id=SDATA-201605

Objective: The primary objective of this analysis is to develop predictive models that can accurately assess the factors contributing to food accessibility and profitability for farming households in Africa. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to identify the crucial determinants affecting food accessibility and profitability, thereby providing insights that can inform policymakers, non-governmental organisations, and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector. Through this analysis, we seek to contribute to the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices and the improvement of food security in the region.
